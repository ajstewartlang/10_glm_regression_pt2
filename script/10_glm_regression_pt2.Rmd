# Overview

First off I'd like you to watch the following video which builds on the first regression workshop. We explore how to build regression models with more than one predictor in R using the `lm()` function, test our model assumptions, and interpret the output. We look at different ways of building stepwise regression models with multiple predictors, before finishing by looking at mediation and moderation.
